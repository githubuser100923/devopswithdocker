# Why and When to Use Kubernetes?

Kubernetes helps automate scaling of container applications. It's originally developed by Google. Docker works with Kubernetes.

Why we should use Kubernetes? Docker is great container tool but it's missing one important feature. It doesn't scale well. It's impossible to use the same container in multiple servers.

Pods in Kubernetes contain one or multiple container. Containers can communicate together. The idea is that often software contains multiple different languages and parts that need seperate images but in the other hand it doesn't make sense to create the containers one by one. With Kubernetes' pods it's possible to simplify this process by handiling multiple containers at once.

In Kubernetes Cluster Service config developer defines pods, how many of them to run, and other important information. Kubernetes Cluster Service makes sure that clusters match with the configurations. If one container for some reason drops for example because server crash Kubernetes Cluster Service will configure the other containers to again match the configuration.

Kubernetes are great for bigger projects that need to scale a lot. It makes it easy to handle things related to scaling like moving servers and setting up new servers. It might lower infrastructure cost.
