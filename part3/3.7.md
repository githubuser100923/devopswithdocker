# Why and When to Use Kubernetes?

Kubernetes helps automate scaling of container applications. It's originally developed by Google. Docker works with Kubernetes.

Why we should use Kubernetes? Docker is great container tool but it's missing one important feature. It doesn't scale well. It's impossible to use the same container in multiple servers. 

Pods in Kubernetes contain one or multiple container. Containers can communicate together. The idea is that often software contains multiple different languages and parts that need seperate images but in the other hand it doesn't make sense to create the containers one by one. With Kubernetes' pods it's possible to simplify this process by handiling multiple containers at once.

Docker compose is one alternative to Kubernetes.
